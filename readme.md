> ### Clojure, HttpKit and Ring codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-example-apps) spec and API.


### [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **Clojure, HttpKit and Ring** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **Clojure** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.


# How it works

Clojure uses HttpKit and Ring to perform routing and request/response handling. With a few lines of code we have a reliable server up and running.

# Getting started

Just a few steps to have you up and running:

+ Download and install [leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen)
+ Clone this repo
+ Open a termninal, navigate to your project folder and type "lein run"

And you're up!
